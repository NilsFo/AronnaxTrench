Enter a submarine and explore the newly discovered Aronnax Trench and catalogue the creatures living inside.

## Story & Gameplay

Genre: Exploration

***

The year is 1997 and you are a freshly graduated marine biologist.
This is your first expedition and you are eager to prove yourself to the world, (and the grant agreements).
With your team on the main boat, you alone enter a submarine and explore the newly discovered Aronnax Trench and catalogue the creatures living inside and maybe make the greatest discovery of the late century?!

## Controls

Use the mouse to scroll through your submarine and interact with the environment.

You can click on the devices and doodats to control your submarine.
Pick up the camera and take a picture of every different fish you can see.
Use the bulletin board to locate and learn more about each fish.
